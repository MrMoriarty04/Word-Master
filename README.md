_This was the final project for **Complete Intro to Web Development, v3** presented by **Mr. Brian Holt** at **Frontend Masters**_.

_In this project, we created a game called Word Masters!_

_The game's objective is to guess a randomly generated five-letter word in English within a maximum of six attempts. 
When you enter a word and press Enter, you will receive one of three results:_

- _If a player guesses a letter in the correct position, it will be highlighted in **green**._
- _If a player guesses a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position, it will be highlighted in **yellow**._
- _If the letter is not in the word at all, it will be displayed in **gray**._

_If the player correctly guesses the secret word, they win, and the game ends and if the player fails to guess it within six tries, they lose._

you can try the game through the following link: https://mrmoriarty04.github.io/Word-Master/

_It was an amazing learning journey_ ! 🤍🚀🚀
